## Usage - Who's playing today?

The footty command line tool lets you query the online football.db HTTP JSON API services
for upcoming or past matches. For example:

    $ footty              # Defaults to today's euro 2024 matches

prints on Jun/14 2024:

    #1 Fri Jun/14            Germany (GER)    vs    Scotland (SCO)         Group A / Matchday 1
   
Use `tomorrow` or `t` or `+1` to print tomorrow's matches e.g.:

    $ footty tomorrow    # -or-
    $ footty t

Use `yesterday` or `y` or `-1` to print yesterday's matches e.g.:

    $ footty yesterday    # -or-
    $ footty y

Use `upcoming` or `up` or `u` to print all upcoming matches e.g.:

    $ footty upcoming    # -or-
    $ footty up

Use `past` or `p` to print all past matches e.g.:

    $ footty past    # -or-
    $ footty p


That's it. Enjoy the beautiful game.
