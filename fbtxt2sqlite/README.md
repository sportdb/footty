## Step 0 - Installation Via Gems

To install the command-line tool via gems (ruby's package manager) use:

```
$ gem install fbtxt2sqlite
```


## Usage

Try in your shell / terminal:

```
$ fbtxt2sqlite -h
```

resulting in:

```
Usage: fbtxt2sqlite [options] DBPATH PATH
        --verbose, --debug           turn on verbose / debug output (default: false)
        --seasons SEASONS            turn on processing only seasons listed                    
```


Let's try to read in the England directory (repo), that is, all match schedules & results
in the Football.TXT format 
(see [`/england`](https://github.com/openfootball/england)) 
that includes the Premier League, Championship, & more:

```
$ fbtxt2sqlite england.db ./england
```

resulting in an sqlite database named `./england.db` with league, team, match, & more records.



That's it.
